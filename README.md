# git-ask-pass (Go + Fyne)

| A custom GIT_ASKPASS GUI tool that doesn't hide your username â€” because you're not typing a password there.

## ðŸ§  Why?
Most default askpass implementations hide both the username and password behind asterisks. That's silly.

This tool:
- shows the username field in plain text (as it should be),
- hides only the password,
- and presents a clean, native-looking UI using the Fyne toolkit.
  
Ideal for developers who are tired of entering long usernames or tokens blindly.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
```bash
cd pkg
cp [path to the binary] ./
./install.sh
source ~/.bashrc  # or restart your shell
```

If you're using zsh or another shell, make sure to export GIT_ASKPASS manually in your shell config:
```bash
export GIT_ASKPASS="$HOME/.local/bin/git-ask-pass"
```

## ðŸ”§ Uninstallation
```bash
cd pkg
uninstall.sh
```

## ðŸ›  Requirements

### If you want to compile it yourself
- Go 1.24.1+ to build
- make
- git
- [Fyne framework](https://docs.fyne.io/started/) dependencies
- upx for binary compression (Optional)

```bash
make
upx --best --lzma ./build/git-ask-pass
```
  
### If you want to use precompiled binary
Install manually:
- Download the binary
- Place it anywhere (e.g., ~/.local/bin/)
- Export the GIT_ASKPASS variable:
  ```bash
  export GIT_ASKPASS="$HOME/.local/bin/git-ask-pass"
  ```
That's it â€” you're ready to go.
